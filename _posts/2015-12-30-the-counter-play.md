The counter play in football is simple; the entire
offense heads in one direction while the running
back cuts and heads the opposite way. Do you know
that Christianity is really a counter play? The world
advises, "Do it on your own." Christ says, "I'll do it for
you." The world suggests, "Advance by domination."
Christ says, "Advance by service." The world chants,
"Seize it now." Christ says "Wait for the kingdom to
come." The world cries, "Vengeance!" Christ whispers, "Forgiveness!"
The world says, "All roads lead to heaven." Christ
says, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life!" The
world calls standard plays, resulting in brokenness and
separation. But you can "run the counter" by trusting
in Christ, instead of yourself, and this world.
"The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does
the will of God lives forever" (I John 2:17). 

Are you willing to be counter-cultural?
