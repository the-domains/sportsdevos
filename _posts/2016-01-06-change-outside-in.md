Have you experienced what it's like to be on the outside? The full understanding that you are without 
a set of benefits that insiders enjoy is painful. We feel 
this when we are not welcome in a group or invited to 
join the team. When we sense the holiness of the God 
Almighty, in light of our deep sinfulness, the separation 
is searing. Because of our willful transgression we 
stand outside of His presence. Thankfully Christ, the 
entirely righteous, divine insider has opened heaven's 
door for us. With His broken body on the cross, He suffered to earn our admission. He transforms darkness 
to light, making enemies to be friends. His power He 
raises dead things back to life. Christ changes everything!
"...Behold, I am making all things new" (Rev 21:5). 

Have you become an insider through Christ Jesus?
