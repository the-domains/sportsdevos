When the distance to the goal line is long and time
is short, football coaches call a Hail Mary pass.
The quarterback is not able to target particular receiv-
ers; he just throws deep down

eld into the crowd, hop-
ing for a miraculous catch. Is that how faith works?
Is dealing with God the same as throwing a Hail Mary
pass? Some people pray to Mohammed, Allah, and
Jesus as if they could cover their bases with this bi-par-
tisan approach. Faith is hope, faith is assurance. Faith
is con

dent expectation of the things ahead. True faith
is based on the reality of what God has done for us in
the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

"Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the
conviction of things not seen" (Heb 11:1).

Is your faith grounded in the firm foundation of Christ?
