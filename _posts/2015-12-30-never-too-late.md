Here is one of the most hopeful phrases in the English language, "It's Never Too Late!" Have you
heard that deceptive voice bellowing, "It's too late,
you've missed your chance!" That is a lie. You can
have another chance. The most hopeful book in the
world - The Bible is filled with people who looked like
they were out of time, out of resources, out of hope. But
when they called on the name of the Lord, with repen-
tance and humility, everything changed! Their situa-
tion, their circumstance, and their life course became
dramatically different. God can do the same for you.
It's Never Too Late!

"Oh give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name;
make known His deeds among the peoples" (Ps 105:1).

Do you need a return of hope in your life?
