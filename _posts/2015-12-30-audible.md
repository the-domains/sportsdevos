A play has been called, the offense runs up to the
line of scrimmage. But as the quarterback surveys
the defense he doesn't like what he sees; running the
same play may bring unfavorable results. Therefore he
calls an audible. Our lives before Christ are made up of
the same schemes, and predictable offenses; deceiving,
carousing, and cheating. It's time for us to call an audi-
ble. A Christ follower has actually 

red themselves as
the offensive coordinator of their life. In an act of sur-
render they have said God I want you to come in and
call the shots. My game plan, my plays, my schemes
didn't work. I hand over the headset to you. You're in
charge now!

"Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world,
but be transformed by the renewing of your mind..."
(Rom 12:2).

Who calls the shots in your life?
