One of the most commonly run plays in all levels
of football is the quarterback keeper. The one
expected to throw becomes the rusher. The one pro-

tected, is suddenly vulnerable. In Israel, the man who
many thought would be the conquering king was in
reality the suffering servant, the Messiah. The Holy
One of God, became sin on our behalf, so that we might
become the righteousness of God (2 Cor 5:21). Many
have opinions of who Jesus is, though God's word
enshrines his identity.

"For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for
the unrighteousness to bring you to God" (I Peter 3:18).

What shocks you about Christ's ministry?
