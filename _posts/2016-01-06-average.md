As a fundraiser, a high school had a men's volleyball team that was coached by the female volley-
ball players. All the baseball, football, and basketball 
players trotted out to try their hand at the new sport. 
They were not volleyball players, so skills were average, but effort was high. One guy played outside hitter 
and his technique was to hit the ball with a closed fist. 
This form allowed a strong strike but little control to 
keep the ball in bounds. But when one of the coaches 
showed them how to hit with an open hand, everything 
changed. His spikes had more power and his ball control improved dramatically. They were completely 
transformed volleyball players. All of us naturally live 
closed fisted lives towards God, but when we loosen 
our grip toward him, we finally breakthrough! When 
we open up to the Living God we find restoration, we 
"...I will confess my transgressions to the Lord and 
you forgave the iniquity of my sin" (Ps 32:5). 

What does it take to live an extraordinary life?
