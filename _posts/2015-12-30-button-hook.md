One of the worst plays a football receiver learns is
the button hook. The mechanics are simple;
the receiver runs full speed and the QB launches the ball while you are running. Then you turn completely
around to catch the airborne ball before the defensive
player can react. We've all run full speed into trouble,
streaking away from God. We've employed our own
game plan, at our pace, based upon our own rules. But
in His grace, He has thrown the plan of salvation our
way. While we were sprinting out of bounds, Christ
walked to the cross. While we lived in unrighteous-
ness, He lived a perfect life. The only response needed
is to turn completely to receive His new life. A Christian simply defined is one who has run the button hook.
He ran away with the world, but turned to catch the
Gospel!
"While we were yet sinners Christ died for us" (Rom 5:8)
. 

Have you turned around to for the most important
catch of your life?
