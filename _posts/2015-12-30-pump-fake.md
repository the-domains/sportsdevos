With the ball in hand, the quarterback drops back
and goes through the throwing motion. But he
doesn't release the ball and instead pitches to a differ-
ent teammate. Many people pump fake on God, going
through the motions of a phony routine. A nice suit and
a ritual coupled with a life of willful rebellion. They
state noble intentions, but hold on to their sin, side-
stepping the fullness of life available through genuine
relationship with Christ Jesus. With a pump fake nothing happens. No action occurs, it's a vain move. An
actual throw produces motion; it puts the ball into play
for a connection with Christ and brings life to the full
and life eternal. Pump fakes will never spiritually suffice, but a genuine outpouring of repentance will result
in relationship.

"I tell you, this man went down to his house justified,
rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself
will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will
be exalted" (Luke 18:14).

Do you pump fake God or have a real relationship with
Christ?
