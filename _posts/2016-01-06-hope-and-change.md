It seems everyone is interested in change. The political realm is swirling with this campaign slogan. The 
bottom line is that we all need hope and we all desire 
change. Whatever type of change you're interested in, 
physical, financial, societal, or relational; the root is 
spiritual. Because our vertical, the line between God 
and us, is out of whack due to our rebellion, our horizontal plane suffers. But when you restore the verti-
cal by surrendering to Christ, then lasting horizontal 
change begins to take place. Settling your tomorrow 
reshapes your today. Christ is our ultimate hope, He 
makes change a reality!
"For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus 
to do good works, which God prepared in advance for 
us to do" (Eph 2:10). 

What is your highest hope?
