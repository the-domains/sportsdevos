God is involved in many different industries; creation, life, and judgment for sure. But there is one
enterprise that we see him engaged in throughout The

Bible. God is in the business of reconciliation through
his son, Jesus Christ. In an unbelievable stance of gra-
ciousness, God allows us to bring Him all of our spiri-
tual debts, which He has preemptively paid through His
sacri

ce on the cross. When we step out of bounds, He
beckons us back inside the lines. We strike out, but He
allows us to swing the bat again. This radical reconcili-
ation costs us only three small, very humbling words.

"I'm sorry, Father."

"Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven,
whose sins are covered" (Ps 32:1).

Have you been reconciled to Christ?
