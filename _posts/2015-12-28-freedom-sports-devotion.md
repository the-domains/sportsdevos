Every week on the news we find another group of
people wrestling for their liberty from powerful 
forces that seek to restrain them. In every corner of 
globe this struggle rages. The thirst for freedom is universal as our hearts instinctively yearn to come out from 
under the rule of dictators. Jesus Christ is the greatest 
Freedom Fighter. The bible says that, "It is for freedom that Christ set us free..." (Gal 5:1). He sets us free 
spiritually from the debilitating darkness of sin, and 
unshackles us from anything that holds us back... debt / 
fear/ wounds/ insecurity/ addictions/ laziness. There is 
nothing that Christ the liberator cannot conquer.
"Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is Freedom" 
(2 Cor 3:17). 

What will you ask the Lord to free you from today?
