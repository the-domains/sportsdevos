The set is up, the hitter is in the air... spike! But
no it's blocked! 

Blocking is a key part of volleyball and the success of every team rests on a defensive game.

All the offensive re power in the world is
irrelevant if the team cannot withstand the oppositional
forces. Middle blockers are pivotal to a formidable
defensive front. On God's team Christ is our blocker.
He intentionally stands up on our behalf and absorbs
the wrath of God for us. He blocks the just punishment
that is headed our way. This is propitiation, the absorb-
ing of sin's consequence by another. When you call
on the name of Christ, the only one in the universe who
can handle the full force of the triune God's judgment,
He takes away your sin. He's the only one who can
block for us spiritually! "Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but who-
ever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath
remains on him" (John 3:36).

Have you asked Christ to block for you?
