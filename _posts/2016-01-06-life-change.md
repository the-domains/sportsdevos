We could sum up what Christ's Church is all about
with one phrase - life change! By God's grace, a 
man or woman can come in here with any type of past, 
any religious tradition, any level of Bible knowledge 
and experience life change through the power of the 
Gospel. I've read the accounts of lives changed in the 
Bible and have watched first hand as people's lives have 
been changed through faith in Christ Jesus. You may 
have arrived here tired, worried, frustrated, wounded, 
or confused! Know that everything can change as you 
begin to explore, begin to listen, to connect with God 
and his glorious Gospel. Offer Him your life and He 
will CHANGE IT! In Christ, you will experience the 
dramatic and total life change that comes only through 
the power of God. 
"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. 
The old has passed away; behold, the new has come" 
(2 Cor 5:17). 

How would you like Christ Jesus to change your life?
