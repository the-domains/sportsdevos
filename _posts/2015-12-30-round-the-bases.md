Goal of baseball - Get your teammates all the way
around the bases and back home.

Goal of the Christian church - get all people, every-
where around the spiritual bases of life and home to
heaven!

1st Base: You have been speci

cally designed by our
loving Creator to be in fellowship with Him!

2nd Base: We have walked away from that fellowship,
desiring to do our own things.

3rd Base: The Lord Jesus intervened in human history,
sacri

cing Himself on the cross in order to restore fel-
lowship between God and man.

Home Plate - When we genuinely come to Him, ready
to repent, and allow Him to change us -- He promises
to reside forever within us, and establish our eternal
dwelling within his kingdom.

"I go and prepare a place for you" (John 14:1-3).

Do you understand the spiritual bases of life?
