Triple plays are rare jewels to witness. One night,
a guy playing shortstop called out to his girlfriend
playing second before the pitch and said, "Hey babe

let's turn a triple play."

Boom! The ball was hit in a line drive right to him. He
quickly pitched to his girlfriend on second, who then
threw to first. In one miraculous moment the play was
complete, the opposing side retired. One, two, three
out! This couple took care of business, and the inning
was over. Just like that guy called the play beforehand,
the bible foretold that Christ would perform the ulti-
mate triple play on the cross 

He perfectly fulfilled the
law, He absorbed our punishment, and He opened eternity in heaven for all who would receive him. Mission
accomplished. Death done!

"O death, where is your victory? O death, where is
your sting?" (1 Cor 15:5).

Have you received Christ's gift of eternal life?
