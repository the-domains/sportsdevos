Baseball & softball feature lots of sprinting. From
the moment the ball pings off the bat, players 
begin racing around. We run toward security, we scurry 
to avoid the tag. All we want is to be safe, on that base, 
freed from the penalties of our sin and the weariness of 
life's trials. While you're running, you're in danger, 
unsafe until you make contact with the Savior. That's 
where true security is found. And when you land on 
His base, no matter what, He chases after you and will 
bring you all the way home!
"There is therefore now no condemnation for those 
who are in Christ Jesus" (Rom 8:1).

Are you standing on the base of Christ?
