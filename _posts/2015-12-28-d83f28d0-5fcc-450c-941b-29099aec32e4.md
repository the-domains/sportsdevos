People often didn't realize the degree of skill and
athleticism necessary to play in a competitive sport 
league. Let's be honest, if a player doesn't have at 
least above average proficiency then they may not be 
ready to play at the top level. Did you know that there 
are eligibility requirements to be on God's team? Oh 
yes that's right. Not heritage, resources, appearance or 
performance. Making the squad requires comprehensive 
repentance. No qualification, just a proper response to 
His majesty. Only one thing determines who makes the 
heavenly roster - a sorrowful turn of the heart towards 
Christ's gift of eternal life.
"For Godly grief produces a repentance that leads to 
salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death" (2 Cor 7:10). 

Have you repented to the King of Kings?
