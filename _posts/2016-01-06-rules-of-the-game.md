Every game has rules that define the boundaries of
appropriate play and ensure equitable competition. 
Without rules there would be no order, and the game 
would descend into crisis. Do you recognize the moral 
law, God's transcendent standards for human behavior? 
The first commandment directs our attention upward 
to our Heavenly Father. We are to give thanks to Him 
as our life giver and sustainer. He is the source of all 
creation and we are commanded to recognize this truth 
and worship Him accordingly. It is His rules that should 
guide our entire life, still we obstinately rebel. Thank-
fully God the Father gave us the law, and Jesus Christ 
lived it out by righteously offering Himself up in order 
to earn our amnesty.
"He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, 
so that we might become the righteousness of God in 
Him" (2 Cor 5:21). 

How have you violated the rules of the game of life?
