In the great sport movie, Rudy, we see a man who
badly desires to be a part of a certain team. He is
willing to do literally anything to play football for
Notre Dame; leaving everything he knows behind,
sleeping in a shed, and suffering physical beating on
the practice team. He's fueled by the dream of running
out onto that field wearing a golden helmet.

Are you on God's team? Do you listen to the coach?
Are you at practice? Do you know the playbook?
Don't miss out and remain on the sidelines. For those
on God's team will experience a triumph beyond our
imagination, victory over death!

"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge,
but fools despise wisdom and discipline" (Pv 1:7).

What does it take to be on God's team?
