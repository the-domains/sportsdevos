            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Making The Team</h1><p>In the great sport movie, Rudy, we see a man who
badly desires to be a part of a certain team. He is
willing to do literally anything to play football for
Notre Dame; leaving everything he knows behind,
sleeping in a shed, and suffering physical beating on
the practice team. He’s fueled by the dream of running
out onto that field wearing a golden helmet.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Pump Fake</h1><p>With the ball in hand, the quarterback drops back
and goes through the throwing motion. But he
doesn’t release the ball and instead pitches to a differ-
ent teammate. Many people pump fake on God, going
through the motions of a phony routine. A nice suit and
a ritual coupled with a life of willful rebellion. They
state noble intentions, but hold on to their sin, side-
stepping the fullness of life available through genuine
relationship with Christ Jesus. With a pump fake nothing happens. No action occurs, it’s a vain move. An
actual throw produces motion; it puts the ball into play
for a connection with Christ and brings life to the full
and life eternal. Pump fakes will never spiritually suffice, but a genuine outpouring of repentance will result
in relationship.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Audible</h1><p>A play has been called, the offense runs up to the
line of scrimmage. But as the quarterback surveys
the defense he doesn’t like what he sees; running the
same play may bring unfavorable results. Therefore he
calls an audible. Our lives before Christ are made up of
the same schemes, and predictable offenses; deceiving,
carousing, and cheating. It’s time for us to call an audi-
ble. A Christ follower has actually </p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Button Hook]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Button Hook</h1><p>One of the worst plays a football receiver learns is
the button hook. The mechanics are simple;
the receiver runs full speed and the QB launches the ball while you are running. Then you turn completely
around to catch the airborne ball before the defensive
player can react. We’ve all run full speed into trouble,
streaking away from God. We’ve employed our own
game plan, at our pace, based upon our own rules. But
in His grace, He has thrown the plan of salvation our
way. While we were sprinting out of bounds, Christ
walked to the cross. While we lived in unrighteous-
ness, He lived a perfect life. The only response needed
is to turn completely to receive His new life. A Christian simply defined is one who has run the button hook.
He ran away with the world, but turned to catch the
Gospel!
“While we were yet sinners Christ died for us” (Rom 5:8)
. </p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[The Counter Play]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Counter Play</h1><p>The counter play in football is simple; the entire
offense heads in one direction while the running
back cuts and heads the opposite way. Do you know
that Christianity is really a counter play? The world
advises, “Do it on your own.” Christ says, “I’ll do it for
you.” The world suggests, “Advance by domination.”
Christ says, “Advance by service.” The world chants,
“Seize it now.” Christ says “Wait for the kingdom to
come.” The world cries, “Vengeance!” Christ whispers, “Forgiveness!”
The world says, “All roads lead to heaven.” Christ
says, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life!” The
world calls standard plays, resulting in brokenness and
separation. But you can “run the counter” by trusting
in Christ, instead of yourself, and this world.
“The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does
the will of God lives forever” (I John 2:17). </p></article>]]></description>
