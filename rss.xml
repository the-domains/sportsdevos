            <title><![CDATA[Change Outside In]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Change Outside In</h1><p>Have you experienced what it’s like to be on the outside? The full understanding that you are without 

a set of benefits that insiders enjoy is painful. We feel 

this when we are not welcome in a group or invited to 

join the team. When we sense the holiness of the God 

Almighty, in light of our deep sinfulness, the separation 

is searing. Because of our willful transgression we 

stand outside of His presence. Thankfully Christ, the 

entirely righteous, divine insider has opened heaven’s 

door for us. With His broken body on the cross, He suffered to earn our admission. He transforms darkness 

to light, making enemies to be friends. His power He 

raises dead things back to life. Christ changes everything!

“...Behold, I am making all things new” (Rev 21:5). </p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Hope & Change]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Hope & Change</h1><p>It seems everyone is interested in change. The political realm is swirling with this campaign slogan. The 

bottom line is that we all need hope and we all desire 

change. Whatever type of change you’re interested in, 

physical, financial, societal, or relational; the root is 

spiritual. Because our vertical, the line between God 

and us, is out of whack due to our rebellion, our horizontal plane suffers. But when you restore the verti-
cal by surrendering to Christ, then lasting horizontal 

change begins to take place. Settling your tomorrow 

reshapes your today. Christ is our ultimate hope, He 

makes change a reality!

“For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus 

to do good works, which God prepared in advance for 

us to do” (Eph 2:10). </p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Life Change]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Life Change</h1><p>We could sum up what Christ’s Church is all about

with one phrase - life change! By God’s grace, a 

man or woman can come in here with any type of past, 

any religious tradition, any level of Bible knowledge 

and experience life change through the power of the 

Gospel. I’ve read the accounts of lives changed in the 

Bible and have watched first hand as people’s lives have 

been changed through faith in Christ Jesus. You may 

have arrived here tired, worried, frustrated, wounded, 

or confused! Know that everything can change as you 

begin to explore, begin to listen, to connect with God 

and his glorious Gospel. Offer Him your life and He 

will CHANGE IT! In Christ, you will experience the 

dramatic and total life change that comes only through 

the power of God. 

“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. 

The old has passed away; behold, the new has come” 

(2 Cor 5:17). </p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Rules Of The Game]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Rules Of The Game</h1><p>Every game has rules that define the boundaries of

appropriate play and ensure equitable competition. 

Without rules there would be no order, and the game 

would descend into crisis. Do you recognize the moral 

law, God’s transcendent standards for human behavior? 

The first commandment directs our attention upward 

to our Heavenly Father. We are to give thanks to Him 

as our life giver and sustainer. He is the source of all 

creation and we are commanded to recognize this truth 

and worship Him accordingly. It is His rules that should 

guide our entire life, still we obstinately rebel. Thank-
fully God the Father gave us the law, and Jesus Christ 

lived it out by righteously offering Himself up in order 

to earn our amnesty.

“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, 

so that we might become the righteousness of God in 

Him” (2 Cor 5:21). </p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Average]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Average</h1><p>As a fundraiser, a high school had a men’s volleyball team that was coached by the female volley-
ball players. All the baseball, football, and basketball 

players trotted out to try their hand at the new sport. 

They were not volleyball players, so skills were average, but effort was high. One guy played outside hitter 

and his technique was to hit the ball with a closed fist. 

This form allowed a strong strike but little control to 

keep the ball in bounds. But when one of the coaches 

showed them how to hit with an open hand, everything 

changed. His spikes had more power and his ball control improved dramatically. They were completely 

transformed volleyball players. All of us naturally live 

closed fisted lives towards God, but when we loosen 

our grip toward him, we finally breakthrough! When 

we open up to the Living God we find restoration, we 

“...I will confess my transgressions to the Lord and 

you forgave the iniquity of my sin” (Ps 32:5). </p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Making The Team</h1><p>In the great sport movie, Rudy, we see a man who
badly desires to be a part of a certain team. He is
willing to do literally anything to play football for
Notre Dame; leaving everything he knows behind,
sleeping in a shed, and suffering physical beating on
the practice team. He’s fueled by the dream of running
out onto that field wearing a golden helmet.

            <title><![CDATA[Pump Fake]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Pump Fake</h1><p>With the ball in hand, the quarterback drops back
and goes through the throwing motion. But he
doesn’t release the ball and instead pitches to a differ-
ent teammate. Many people pump fake on God, going
through the motions of a phony routine. A nice suit and
a ritual coupled with a life of willful rebellion. They
state noble intentions, but hold on to their sin, side-
stepping the fullness of life available through genuine
relationship with Christ Jesus. With a pump fake nothing happens. No action occurs, it’s a vain move. An
actual throw produces motion; it puts the ball into play
for a connection with Christ and brings life to the full
and life eternal. Pump fakes will never spiritually suffice, but a genuine outpouring of repentance will result
in relationship.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Audible</h1><p>A play has been called, the offense runs up to the
line of scrimmage. But as the quarterback surveys
the defense he doesn’t like what he sees; running the
same play may bring unfavorable results. Therefore he
calls an audible. Our lives before Christ are made up of
the same schemes, and predictable offenses; deceiving,
carousing, and cheating. It’s time for us to call an audi-
ble. A Christ follower has actually </p></article>]]></description>
