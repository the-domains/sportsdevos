            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Safe With The Savior Sports Devotional</h1><p>Baseball & softball feature lots of sprinting. From

the moment the ball pings off the bat, players 

begin racing around. We run toward security, we scurry 

to avoid the tag. All we want is to be safe, on that base, 

freed from the penalties of our sin and the weariness of 

life’s trials. While you’re running, you’re in danger, 

unsafe until you make contact with the Savior. That’s 

where true security is found. And when you land on 

His base, no matter what, He chases after you and will 

bring you all the way home!

“There is therefore now no condemnation for those 

who are in Christ Jesus” (Rom 8:1).</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Freedom Sports Devotion]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Freedom Sports Devotion</h1><p>Every week on the news we find another group of

people wrestling for their liberty from powerful 

forces that seek to restrain them. In every corner of 

globe this struggle rages. The thirst for freedom is universal as our hearts instinctively yearn to come out from 

under the rule of dictators. Jesus Christ is the greatest 

Freedom Fighter. The bible says that, “It is for freedom that Christ set us free...” (Gal 5:1). He sets us free 

spiritually from the debilitating darkness of sin, and 

unshackles us from anything that holds us back... debt / 

fear/ wounds/ insecurity/ addictions/ laziness. There is 

nothing that Christ the liberator cannot conquer.

“Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is Freedom” 

(2 Cor 3:17). </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5eff7dfe7415c4893d0e45d921773c61db3c321b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
