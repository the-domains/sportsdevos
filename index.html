The full understanding that you are without 

a set of benefits that insiders enjoy is painful. We feel 

this when we are not welcome in a group or invited to 

join the team. When we sense the holiness of the God 

Almighty, in light of our deep sinfulness, the separation 

is searing. Because of our willful transgression we 

stand outside of His presence. Thankfully Christ, the 

entirely righteous, divine insider has opened heaven’s 

door for us. With His broken body on the cross, He suffered to earn our admission. He transforms darkness 

to light, making enemies to be friends. His power He 

raises dead things back to life. Christ changes everything!

bottom line is that we all need hope and we all desire

physical, financial, societal, or relational; the root is 

spiritual. Because our vertical, the line between God 

and us, is out of whack due to our rebellion, our horizontal plane suffers. But when you restore the verti-
cal by surrendering to Christ, then lasting horizontal 

change begins to take place. Settling your tomorrow 

reshapes your today. Christ is our ultimate hope, He 

makes change a reality!

been changed through faith in Christ Jesus. You may 

have arrived here tired, worried, frustrated, wounded,

will CHANGE IT! In Christ, you will experience the 

dramatic and total life change that comes only through 

the power of God.

players trotted out to try their hand at the new sport. 

They were not volleyball players, so skills were average, but effort was high. One guy played outside hitter 

and his technique was to hit the ball with a closed fist. 

This form allowed a strong strike but little control to 

keep the ball in bounds. But when one of the coaches 

showed them how to hit with an open hand, everything 

changed. His spikes had more power and his ball control improved dramatically. They were completely 

transformed volleyball players. All of us naturally live 

closed fisted lives towards God, but when we loosen 

our grip toward him, we finally breakthrough! When 

we open up to the Living God we find restoration, we

through the motions of a phony routine. A nice suit and
a ritual coupled with a life of willful rebellion. They
state noble intentions, but hold on to their sin, side-
stepping the fullness of life available through genuine
relationship with Christ Jesus. With a pump fake nothing happens. No action occurs, it’s a vain move. An
actual throw produces motion; it puts the ball into play
for a connection with Christ and brings life to the full
and life eternal. Pump fakes will never spiritually suffice, but a genuine outpouring of repentance will result
in relationship.

the button hook. The mechanics are simple;
the receiver runs full speed and the QB launches the ball while you are running. Then you turn completely

player can react. We’ve all run full speed into trouble,
streaking away from God. We’ve employed our own
game plan, at our pace, based upon our own rules. But
in His grace, He has thrown the plan of salvation our
way. While we were sprinting out of bounds, Christ
walked to the cross. While we lived in unrighteous-
ness, He lived a perfect life. The only response needed
is to turn completely to receive His new life. A Christian simply defined is one who has run the button hook.
He ran away with the world, but turned to catch the
